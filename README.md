# Cipher Education in Java

## Overview
**Cipher Education** is an interactive educational tool designed to demonstrate various encryption methods, including Caesar, monoalphabetic, and transposition ciphers. Built using Java's AWT and Swing libraries, the program features a user-friendly graphical interface that visually illustrates encryption techniques and their strengths. The project aims to educate users on fundamental cryptographic concepts while providing an in-depth understanding of each cipher's functionality.

## Features
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Developed with AWT and Swing, the graphical user interface allows users to input custom text and visualize real-time encryption using various ciphers.
- **Multiple Ciphers:** Implements different encryption techniques:
  - **Caesar Cipher:** Demonstrates basic character shifting with limited encoding possibilities.
  - **Monoalphabetic Cipher:** Utilizes HashMaps to create randomized character mappings, greatly increasing encoding complexity.
  - **Transposition Cipher:** Uses matrices to rearrange characters, with advanced versions injecting random elements to further obscure the data.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Each cipher is accompanied by an explanation and real-time visualization of the encryption process.
- **Data Management:** Utilizes data structures like HashMaps, ArrayLists, and matrices to efficiently manage and access cipher keys and data.
- **Encryption and Decryption:** Provides mechanisms for encoding and decoding input strings, allowing users to explore how each cipher works.
- **Security:** Maintains data integrity with robust error handling, private variables, and secure data storage using private classes.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Libraries:** AWT, Swing
